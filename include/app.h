/**
 * @struct App
 * @brief Top-level application container. 
 * 
 * The 'App' structure encapsulates one 'University' instance and a global 'StudentList'.
 * 
 * Lifetime and Ownership:
 * - 'App' owns the 'University*' instance and the 'StudentList'.
 * - The 'University' owns all 'Faculty' objects (composition relationship);
 * - Each 'Faculty' owns its 'Group' objects (composition relationship); 
 * - There cannot be two 'Group' and 'Faculty' instances with the same ID across the university;
 * - Each 'Group' maintains non-owning references to 'Student' objects and each 'Student' mainatains non-owning 
 *   references to 'Group' pbjects (many-to-many association relationship).
 * 
 * Cleanup:
 * Call app_destroy() to free the data recursively:
 * 
 * App -> University -> Faculties -> Groups.
 *    â†˜ 
 *     StudentList -> Students
 *
